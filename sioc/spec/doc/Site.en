A Site is the location of an online community or set of communities, with UserAccounts in Usergroups creating content therein. While an individual Forum or group of Forums are usually hosted on a centralised Site, in the future the concept of a "site" may be extended (for example, a topic Thread could be formed by Posts in a distributed Forum on a peer-to-peer environment Space).
